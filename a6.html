    <br><h1 class="aq"><u>About Audi-A6</u></h1>
    <h3>Audi India has launched the 2020 A6 in India at Rs 54.20 lakh (ex-showroom India). The eight generation model in India is available in its standard guise and comes with a 2.0-litre petrol engine only. It develops 248PS and 370Nm and comes mated with a 7-speed DCT sending power to its front wheels. The 2020 Audi A6 is available in two variants: Premium Plus and Technology.

The styling of the 2020 A6 is evolutionary and comes with sharper lines all around. It is also the first Audi in India to come with a twin touchscreen central console with the top one handling infotainment duties and the lower one handling climate control duties.

Notable features in the A6 include connected-car tech, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, quad-zone climate control, sunroof, wireless phone charger, Audi’s drive select, ambient lighting, park assist, wireless phone charger as well as keyless entry with push button start. Safety features in the 2020 A6 include eight airbags, ABS with EBD, front and rear parking sensors, rear parking camera, electronic stability program, traction control, electric parking with auto hold and lane departure warning.

Primary rivals for the A6 are the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E Class and Volvo S90.</h3>

    <h1 class="over"><u>Audi-A6 OverView</u></h1>
    <h3>The new A6 looks stunning in a very understated fashion. Audi haven't re-invented the wheel here just sharpened the edges. Standouts are the large grill, low stance and semi-aero 10-spoke alloy wheel pattern.

The interiors are a new geeky take on executive luxury with a clean modern design mixed with flashy luxury bits like three coloured screens and open pore wood inserts. It's a reasonably practical cabin for the family with four cup holders storage in all four doors. More storage for nick knacks wouldn't have hurt though. In the rear there's sun/privacy shades as well. The rear windscreen is electrically operated while the side window ones are manual. Entertainment on the Technology variants is via a 10.1 inch touch screen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and features a haptec touch function which requires you to click on the screen to action button functions. This can be disabled as well for a more conventional touch screen experience. The Bang & Olufsen 16 speaker audio system is a treat for audiophiles with crystal clear sound and solid bass. There's even ambient lighting with a dual colour setup and even allows you to set up a custom colours.</h3>
